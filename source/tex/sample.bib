   abstract = {Historically, research into the lymphatic system has been overlooked due to both a lack of knowledge and limited recognition of its importance. In the last decade however, lymphatic research has gained substantial momentum and has included the development of a variety of computational models to aid understanding of this complex system. This article reviews existing computational fluid dynamic models of the lymphatics covering each structural component including the initial lymphatics, pre-collecting and collecting vessels, and lymph nodes. This is followed by a summary of limitations and gaps in existing computational models and reasons that development in this field has been hindered to date. Over the next decade, efforts to further characterize lymphatic anatomy and physiology are anticipated to provide key data to further inform and validate lymphatic fluid dynamic models. Development of more comprehensive multiscale- and multi-physics computational models has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of lymphatic function in both health and disease.},

   abstract = {The observed properties of valves in collecting lymphatic vessels include transmural pressure-dependent bias to the open state and hysteresis. The bias may reduce resistance to ﬂow when the vessel is functioning as a conduit. However, lymphatic pumping implies a streamwise increase in mean pressure across each valve, suggesting that the bias is then potentially unhelpful. Lymph pumping by a model of several collecting lymphatic vessel segments (lymphangions) in series, which incorporated these properties, was investigated under conditions of adverse pressure difference while varying the refractory period between active muscular contractions and the inter-lymphangion contraction delay. It was found that many combinations of the timing parameters and the adverse pressure difference led to one or more intermediate valves remaining open instead of switching between open and closed states during repetitive contraction cycles. Cyclic valve switching was reliably indicated if the mean pressure in a lymphangion over a cycle was higher than that in the lymphangion upstream, but either lack of or very brief valve closure could cause mean pressure to be lower downstream. Widely separated combinations of refractory period and delay time were found to produce the greatest ﬂow-rate for a given pressure difference. The efficiency of pumping was always maximized by a long refractory period and lymphangion contraction starting when the contraction of the lymphangion immediately upstream was peaking. By means of an ex vivo experiment, it was verified that intermediate valves in a chain of pumping lymphangions can remain open, while the lymphangions on either side of the open valve continue to execute contractions.},

   abstract = {Lymph is transported along collecting lymphatic vessels by intrinsic and extrinsic pumping. The walls have muscle of a type intermediate between blood-vascular smooth muscle and myocardium; a contracting segment between two valves (a lymphangion) constitutes a pump. This intrinsic mechanism is investigated ex vivo in isolated, spontaneously contracting, perfused segments subjected to controlled external pressures. The reaction to varying afterload is probed by slowly ramping up the outlet pressure until pumping fails. Often the failure occurs when the contraction raises intra-lymphangion pressure insufficiently to overcome the outlet pressure, open the outlet valve and cause ejection, but many segments fail by other means, the mechanisms of which are not clear. We here elucidate those mechanisms by resort to a numerical model. Experimental observations are paired with comparable findings from computer simulations, using a lumped-parameter model that incorporates previously measured valve properties, plus new measurements of active contractile and passive elastic properties, and the dependence of contraction frequency on transmural pressure, all taken from isobaric twitch contraction experiments in the same vessel. Surprisingly, the model predicts seven different possible modes of pump failure, each defined by a different sequence of valve events, with their occurrence depending on the parameter values and boundary conditions. Some, but not all, modes were found experimentally. Further model investigation reveals routes by which a vessel exhibiting one mode of failure might under altered circumstances exhibit another.},

   abstract = {Secondary lymphatic valves are essential for minimizing backflow of lymph and are presumed to gate passively according to the instantaneous trans-valve pressure gradient. We hypothesized that valve gating is also modulated by vessel distention, which could alter leaflet stiffness and coaptation. To test this hypothesis, we devised protocols to measure the small pressure gradients required to open or close lymphatic valves and determine if the gradients varied as a function of vessel diameter. Lymphatic vessels were isolated from rat mesentery, cannulated, and pressurized using a servo-control system. Detection of valve leaflet position simultaneously with diameter and intraluminal pressure changes in two-valve segments revealed the detailed temporal relationships between these parameters during the lymphatic contraction cycle. The timing of valve movements was similar to that of cardiac valves, but only when lymphatic vessel afterload was elevated. The pressure gradients required to open or close a valve were determined in one-valve segments during slow, ramp-wise pressure elevation, either from the input or output side of the valve. Tests were conducted over a wide range of baseline pressures (and thus diameters) in passive vessels as well as in vessels with two levels of imposed tone. Surprisingly, the pressure gradient required for valve closure varied _20-fold (0.1-2.2 cmH2O) as a passive vessel progressively distended. Similarly, the pressure gradient required for valve opening varied sixfold with vessel distention. Finally, our functional evidence supports the concept that lymphatic muscle tone exerts an indirect effect on valve gating. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

   abstract = {Collecting lymphatic vessels share functional and biochemical characteristics with cardiac muscle; thus, we hypothesized that the lymphatic vessel pump would exhibit behavior analogous to homeometric regulation of the cardiac pump in its adaptation to elevated afterload, i.e., an increase in contractility. Single lymphangions containing two valves were isolated from the rat mesenteric microcirculation, cannulated, and pressurized for in vitro study. Pressures at either end of the lymphangion [input pressure (Pin), preload; output pressure (Pout), afterload] were set by a servo controller. Intralymphangion pressure (PL) was measured using a servo-null micropipette while internal diameter and valve positions were monitored using video methods. The responses to step- and ramp-wise increases in Pout (at low, constant Pin) were determined. PL and diameter data recorded during single contraction cycles were used to generate pressure-volume (P-V) relationships for the subsequent analysis of lymphangion pump behavior. Ramp-wise Pout elevation led to progressive vessel constriction, a rise in end-systolic diameter, and an increase in contraction frequency. Step-wise Pout elevation produced initial vessel distention followed by time-dependent declines in endsystolic and end-diastolic diameters. Significantly, a 30% leftward shift in the end-systolic P-V relationship accompanied an 84% increase in dP/dt after a step increase in Pout, consistent with an increase in contractility. Calculations of stroke work from the P-V loop area revealed that robust pumps produced net positive work to expel fluid throughout the entire afterload range, whereas weaker pumps exhibited progressively more negative work as gradual afterload elevation led to pump failure. We conclude that lymphatic muscle adapts to output pressure elevation with an intrinsic increase in contractility and that this compensatory mechanism facilitates the maintenance of lymph pump output in the face of edemagenic and/or gravitational loads. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.},
