    Reproducibility study to simulate a chain of collapsible contracting lymphangions with progressive valve closure
  description: This paper presents a reproduced computational model of lymphatic collecting vessels. The model was originally introduced by Bertram et al. (2011), and comprises a series of contractile segments, known as lymphangions, interconnected by secondary lymphatic valves. The model focused on elucidating the pumping behavior of contracting lymphangions and deriving pump-characteristic curves, by incorporating pressure-dependent valve resistance, passive elasticity, and active contraction terms in multiple lymphangions connected in series.
